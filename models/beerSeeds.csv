MÃ¶nchshof Premium Schwarzbier,German-Style Schwarzbier,4.9,0,"Schwarzbier means ""black beer"" in German. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a ""black Pils,"" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.",,,,,,,,

It is made with pale candy sugar and has a very pale color produced from a mash of light pilsener malts. Styrian Goldings hops are used along with some German varieties and the classic Saaz pilsener hop. After a long secondary fermentation, the Tripel Westmalle is bottled with a dose of sugar and yeast. This beer holds up well in the bottle over time and seems to soften with age.",Brouwerij Abdij der Trappisten van Westmalle,Antwerpsesteenweg 476,Westmalle,Antwerpen,Belgium,,32-033-12-05-35,http://www.trappistwestmalle.be

An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes. Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yetiâs hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish.",Great Divide Brewing,2201 Arapahoe Street,Denver,Colorado,United States,80205,1-303-296-9460,http://www.greatdivide.com/

Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples â independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness. As a big, aggressively hopped India Pale Ale, Titan IPA fills this bill â beginning with piney hop aromas and citrus hop flavors, and finishing with a rich, malty sweetness that is carefully balanced with crisp hop bitterness.",Great Divide Brewing,2201 Arapahoe Street,Denver,Colorado,United States,80205,1-303-296-9460,http://www.greatdivide.com/

For those that have the gift of passion for the dark side, it's measured in pints of Oatmeal Stout. Another one of FiftyFifty's seasonals, the Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is brown to black in color and nearly opaque. It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year.

The goal was to create a base for showing off the unique floral qualities of two Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus and Cascade. Columbus is a new hybrid High Alpha Acid hop used mostly for bittering, but used heavily as an aromatic in this strong brew. Cascade is the balance that ties the malt and bittering hops together. It is a true specialty ale and is our brewer's statement on this style.",Bear Republic Brewery,345 Healdsburg Avenue,Healdsburg,California,United States,95448,1-707-433-2337,http://www.bearrepublic.com/

Big Bear Black Stout,American-Style Imperial Stout,8.1,0,"Big Bear, as the name implies, is a hefty, black, Russian Imperial-style stout. This bold stout boasts a rich, caramel sweetness lavished by a robust, deep-roasted heartiness you can sink your teeth into. ...Big Bear's bold flavors are produced using a blend of Belgian and English roasted barley and crystal malts. Some unique flavors come forth in the malt character. ...Louisiana sweet molasses and dark brown sugar. This dark brew is well hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops, which are somewhat, masked by the malt. This is a balanced bold brew boasting an A.V.B. of 8.1% that can creep up on you, ""so don't get mauled"". It has a dry roasted quality that masks its' high alchohol content, so drink responsibly. 2004 California State Fair, Silver Medal Winner; 2002 World Beer Cup, Gold Medal Winner;",,,,,,,,

1554 Enlightened Black Ale,Other Belgian-Style Ales,5.5,0,"Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a light lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.",New Belgium Brewing,500 Linden Street,Fort Collins,Colorado,United States,80524,1-888-622-4044,http://www.newbelgium.com/

Gubna Imperial IPA,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale,10,0,"Emphasizing that complexity of character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnât end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.",Oskar Blues Grill and Brew,303 Main Street,Lyons,Colorado,United States,80540,1-303-823-6685,http://www.oskarblues.com/

Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat,South German-Style Hefeweizen,5.3,0,"For our take on the classic hefeweizen style our search for unique ingredients led us to the Eureka and Lisbon varieties of lemon grown in three different regions of California.  These particular lemons added the perfect balance of citrus tartness and sweetness to accent the taste of the beer.  The spiciness of the Hallertau Mittelfruh and Spalt Spalter hops balance out the slightly sweet character of our breweryâs own signature wheat malt, resulting in a crisp and refreshing wheat beer with a subtle lemon aroma and flavor.",Boston Beer Company,30 Germania Street,Boston,Massachusetts,United States,2130,1-800-372-1131,http://www.samueladams.com/

The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish.

This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation.

Signature Pale Ale,American-Style Amber/Red Ale,0,0,"The term ""Pale Ale"" dates back to the 1800s when all beer was dark brown in colour. New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.",Steamworks,375 Water Street,Vancouver,British Columbia,Canada,V6B 5C6,1-604-689-2739,http://www.steamworks.com/gastown_index.htm

Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour.

Bengali Tiger,American-Style India Pale Ale,6.5,0,"Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA.

Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aromaâ¦ we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; itâs the mark of the Tiger.",Sixpoint Craft Ales,40 Van Dyke St,Brooklyn,New York,United States,11231,,http://www.sixpointcraftales.com/

Wet Hop Requiem IPA,American-Style India Pale Ale,5.2,0,"This beauty is a complete work of art! Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven.

Wahoo Wheat Beer,Belgian-Style White,4,0,"Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or ""white"" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark.

It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma, taste, and dryness to the palate.

There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added ""big sacks"" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind.

True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to âthe originalâ pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hopâs pleasant, spicy tone.

Like the Trappist ales from which it sprung, Viszolay is light and refreshing.
